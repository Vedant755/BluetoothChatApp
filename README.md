# Scan Devices feature.
- This is just an section of my ongoing project where I will be making a full fledge chating application which will be purely based on Bluetooth.
- In this part of secton I connected my App with the Bluetooth Adapter feature.
- As I was learning on the go so I have added comments too so that everyone can be able to learn which class is used for which purpose. 
- Feel free to the feature-scannedDevices branch and work on it.
